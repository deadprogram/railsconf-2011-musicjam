You Can't Always Get What You Want
Rolling Stones

  C                      F
I saw her today at the reception
  C                    F
A glass of wine in her hand
  C                              F
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
       C                    F
At her feet was a footloose man

Chorus:
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
           D
But if you try sometimes, 
  F
You might find
                 C              F    C       F
You get what you need...   ahhhhhhh, yeah.....


I went down to the demonstration,
To get my fair share of abuse.
Singing "we're gonna vent our frustration,
And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse."

You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
But if you try sometimes well you might find
You'll get what you need.

I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled.
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy,
And man, did he look pretty ill.
We decided that we would have a soda,
My favorite flavor, cherry red.
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy,
And he said one word to me, and that was "dead,"
I said to him:

You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You'll get what you need, ...oh yes

[instrumental]
You'll get what you need--yeah, oh baby.

I saw her today at the reception,
In her glass was a bleeding man.
She was practiced at the art of deception,
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands.

You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You'll get what you need.

You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
You can't always get what you want,
But if you try sometimes you just might find
You just might find
You'll get what you need.
